This project covers differences between netflix and amazon prime video streaming services

**Buisness neeeds and Website Development**
(10 Marks)
Both of these companies use their websites as streaming services, these sites where developed to effectivly share content with subscribers and to try and keep them engaged for as much as possible. They acchieved this by showing a variety of options catagroised into different sections; top ten lists, thrillers, action movies, easy watching etc and using captivating screenshots to try to sell each show of film to the user.

Starting with Amazon Prime video
Amazon does a lot of their design fairly well nothing is overly clutterd, there is deacent spacing between all the titles. The worst part of it is they are reliant on the thumbnails of each of the show or film for the name, this could cause issues for people with visual impairment as some have low contrast or are overly stialised. One solution for this could be a mode where the title of the program is displayed bellow it. While doing this we could also accomidate certain lerning disabilitys such as dyslexia with a more friendly font and or a higher contrast background.

Netflix also suffers from this issue where all film and tv titles are reliant on the product thumbnail even on its click through menu where it has enough space to cleanly layout the title of the show they instead just go for a darkend preview with the ttitle on top creating some contrast but certain senarios that could still be hard to read.

This could all be fixed with a simple setting in the menu or just by having the click through show the title as normal text in the menu along with the larger styalised version.


**User Analysis**
(25 Marks)
The user of these websites will want catagorised searchable media.
We can use tags to catagorise different media; anime, horror, thriller, action, adventrue, etc etc...
The titeles should be easy to read, can do the title as part of thumbnail but for accessibility there should be an option to display tital with high contrast beneath the thumbnails.
Age rateing should be displayed along with a blurb/synopsis of the media on initial click through.

As a New user I want to easily be able to browse and experience the full libary of media on this site and be able to quickly and painlessly get a grasp of what media they have.
I also want the sign up to be quick and painless

As a returning visitor I want to be able to continue with a show I may have started a while a go making it easy due to period of time i have been inactive it would be nice to be able to pause the subscription for the months i am not using it.

As a frequent user I want accurate recomendations bassed on the shows i have watched aswell as keeping track of what i have completed and am part of the way thorugh.

The accepetence criterea for New user Signup to create an account before creating an account price plans should be laid out plainly with a sign up now button. On the sign up screen it starts with account creation Email, Password, Confirm password and recapturev2 at the worst level of captcha preferably use v3 instead. After the account is succesfully created it should move on to the billing page where the user can select the plan they want, how frequently they want to pay (monthly, yearly) and pay.

The criteria for the returning user is a bit different, once they have logged in they can get a popup (has the box to dismiss popup forever if user does not want it) Popup should contain info about new media they might want eg; New seasons on shows they are watching, or related media that they may like bassed on their history.

The criterea for the frequent user is the most simple it can give them the same popup but if they are frequent enough there might be nothing to display so a check needs to be in place for the popup to not display if empty. Other then that for the general browsing page, Continue watching should be at the top, followed by any shows they mark to watch latter, then recomended, then general browsing in catagorised lists.
